Java Utilities
=========

A repo for Java utilities I can re-use in future projects.

This repo currently contains:

Undo/Redo Util
-----
This repo is designed to make it easy to implement undo/redo in a Java application. It wraps application actions 
using simple interfaces to let undo/redo be built in from the start.
